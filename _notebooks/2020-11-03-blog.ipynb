    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy in Thermodynamics is a measure of a system's disorder: the higher the disorder, the greater the entropy. Information can also be seen as a form of entropic measure. \"Unordered\" information is highly uncertain and presents us with more surprise than certain, organized facts. It is hence more \"informative\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also of interest to note that most concepts in Thermodynamics have corresponding quantities in Information Theory. And this is not by chance, as the arrangement and the evolution of the state of matter relays information and, ultimately, tweaking with the properties of matter is how information is conveyed. Think about the way digital information is transmitted. The standard is to have it transmitted via fluctuations in electromagnetic waves. We modulate these waves with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Theory also finds its way in Machine Learning. Machine Learning is the science of finding patterns, of trying to elicit information from what we observe. I did not use the word information by chance, as the role of models, independent variables, and parameter estimation (in the traditional sense of Maximum-Likelihood estimation) is to obtain from complex observations the essentials for prognostics, prediction, clustering, and a myriad of other processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows we will explore one very interesting quantity: the cross entropy. We will see that its main practical use is to compare a model to experimental data and to tell how much excess information is required for modeling data with a probability distribution different to the true ditribution of the data.

    "## Entropy as a Measure of Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand cross entropy, we must first lay out the foundations of entropy. This quantity is a description of the uncertainty of a random variable. We want to measure how uncertain a probabilistic event is. Essentially, the more unlikely an event is, the more surprising it is and, consequently, the more information it holds. To say that we are observing that it is now raining contains no information. It is a certain event that bears no surprise. However, to say that there is a $35$% probability that it will rain tomorrow does contain information. If we were faced instead with a $50$% probability of rain, would we be more or less certain of tomorrow's weather? It seems reasonable to say that we would be less certain, because the $35$% probability of rain implies a probability of $65$% of no rain, whilst $50$% either way essentially leaves us with the most amount of doubt possible. This is an essential aspect of entropy: it is maximized for equally-likely events. Another illustrative example is a biased die and a fair die. Let us imagine that the biased die is heavily biased towards the six-dotted side such that for this die's events $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, the corresponding set of probabilities is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "\\left\\lbrace \\frac{1}{12},\\frac{1}{12},\\frac{1}{12},\\frac{1}{12},\\frac{1}{12}, \\frac{7}{12} \\right\\rbrace\n",
    "\\\\]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fair die, on the other hand, follows the traditional distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "\\left\\lbrace \\frac{1}{6},\\frac{1}{6},\\frac{1}{6},\\frac{1}{6},\\frac{1}{6},\\frac{1}{6} \\right\\rbrace \n",
    "\\\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to gamble, which die would you pick? Which one makes you less uncertain of your choice, or, better still, which one decreases the entropy you experience? Evidently, it is **not** the fair die, for uniform distributions maximize entropy. No single side of the die seems more promising than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, there is a relationship between the probabilities of a random variable's events and its entropy. Let $X$ be a random variable, $\\mathcal{X}$ its support group, and $H(X)$ its entropy. According to [Cover-Thomas,2006], entropy is defined as\n",

    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\log$ function is defined under base $2$. This gives us the basic unit of information: the bit. Entropy can also be computed with different base values, including $e$, in which case the unit of measurement becomes the \"nat\". It is useful to distinguish now between the information theoretical bit and the bit in computer science. In computer science, the bit is the basic unit of storage. It is the placeholder for data, even redundant, uninformative data. In Information Theory, the bit is the basic unit of actual information, stripped of all redundancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (1) has one important property: $H(x) \\geq 0$, because probability values are greater than or equal to zero. This makes sense, as the natural interpretation of information leads to thinking in terms of having information or not having any.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try the definition of entropy (1) with a numerical example. Let $X$ be a random variable with categories $\\left\\lbrace a,b,c,d \\right\\rbrace$. If the associated probabilities are $\\{ 0.2,0.1,0.3,0.4 \\}$, eq. (1) tells us that\n",

In communication systems, such redundancy is very undesirable, since it results in a surplus of transmitted energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interpretation for entropy that will perhaps make it more intuitive is how many binary questions we have to ask to determine with certainty some piece of information. Say we have a random variable $Y$ with equally-likely events $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$. Say we would like to determine one of those events, how many binary questions do we need?

    "* Is $Y \\geq 1$? Yes, and we have found the targeted element.\n",

    "It is interesting to note that the binary question approach is related to a Machine Learning strategy known as the random tree. And this is in fact very intuitive, as making the right cut-off questions may lead to data conditioning. Conditional probalities produce lower entropy than marginal distributions. This is plain to see, as a conditioning random variable $X$ might give off some information about the conditioned variable $Y$. The conditional entropy $H(Y \\mid X)$ follows the rule $H(Y \\mid X) \\leq H(Y)$, with equality iff $X$ and $Y$ are independent, i.e., they bear no information about each other. The concept of conditional entropy is also fundamental to the definition of mutual information, one of the most important quantities in Information Theory. However, for the sake of brevity, I will not go into detail about this aspect of the theory, but I would like to point the reader to [Cover-Thomas,2006] for more information. \n",
