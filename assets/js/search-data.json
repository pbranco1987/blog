            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .

          "content": "My name is Paulo Branco. I am an electrical engineering with a strong mathematical foundation splitting my time between São Paulo and Florianópolis. My passion is learning and exploring new developments not only in Machine learning, but also in other scientific areas, such as Game Theory, Probability, Information Theory, and Physics. . I have a Ph.D. in Information Theory by the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. I spent a year in Imperial College London for a research internship, during which time I worked with polar lattices and other tools for the quantization and shaping of capacity-achieving lattices. My research has to this day dealt mainly with error correction coding, spectral-efficient lattice coding in Gaussian channels, and cooperative communication schemes in relay networks. However, my plan is to open up my horizons and explore new fields of knowledge and find out what is out there. . My current interest has switched to Machine Learning, but I conserve my original interest in information theoretical topics. I am currently delving into Deep Learning, in particular in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. But, in all honesty, any topic that involves probability, statistics, data wrangling, and applied mathematics is a topic of interest to me. . Please feel free to contact me and to share your research with me. Feel also free to ask me about the contents of my posts, my tutorials. I look forward to sharing, discovering, exploring. If you have any content which you would like me to take a look, any research you are conducting that you would like to share, I am more than willing to converse. . Your Webhost, Paulo Branco .",

Data Science, Machine Learning and Information Theory will be the main topics of discussion. However, I will not exclusively broach these topics, as the intent of this website is to explore my interests, and they are varied. . Aside from that, I will dedicate a page to one of my side passions, which is to explore the history of science. Every so often I intend to issue an article discussing how scientific breakthroughs that are of particular interest to me were achieved. I also intend to summarise and impart to the reader the importance of some seminal papers. . This page also contains data about me, including a page dedicated to my Curriculum Vitae and a page with general information about my purpose in creating a website. . Last but not least, this webpage will also serve to showcase all my Data Science and Machine Learning projects. It will function as a “repo” of sorts. It will be not code-heavy (the code specifics will be available on my github page). It will contan though a walk-through of what I have done in Jupyter Notebook format. .
