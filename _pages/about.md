My name is Paulo Branco. I am an electrical engineering with a strong mathematical foundation splitting my time between São Paulo and Florianópolis. My passion is learning and exploring new developments not only in Machine learning, but also in other scientific areas, such as Game Theory, Probability, Information Theory, and Physics. 

I have a Ph.D. in Information Theory by the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. I spent a year in Imperial College London for a research internship, during which time I worked with polar lattices and other tools for the quantization and shaping of capacity-achieving lattices. My research has to this day dealt mainly with error correction coding, spectral-efficient lattice coding in Gaussian channels, and cooperative communication schemes in relay networks. However, my plan is to open up my horizons and explore new fields of knowledge and find out what is out there.

My current interest has switched to Machine Learning, but I conserve my original interest in information theoretical topics. I am currently delving into Deep Learning, in particular in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. But, in all honesty, any topic that involves probability, statistics, data wrangling, and applied mathematics is a topic of interest to me.

Please feel free to contact me and to share your research with me. Feel also free to ask me about the contents of my posts, my tutorials. I look forward to sharing, discovering, exploring. If you have any content which you would like me to take a look, any research you are conducting that you would like to share, I am more than willing to converse. 

Your Webhost,
Paulo Branco
