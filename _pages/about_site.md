This site has been conceived to provide the reader an array of topics in many fields of research. Data Science, Machine Learning and Information Theory will be the main topics of discussion. However, I will not exclusively broach these topics, as the intent of this website is to explore my interests, and they are varied.

Aside from that, I will dedicate a page to one of my side passions, which is to explore the history of science. Every so often I intend to issue an article discussing how scientific breakthroughs that are of particular interest to me were achieved. I also intend to summarise and impart to the reader the importance of some seminal papers.

This page also contains data about me, including a page dedicated to my Curriculum Vitae and a page with general information about my purpose in creating a website.

Last but not least, this webpage will also serve to showcase all my Data Science and Machine Learning projects. It will function as a "repo" of sorts. It will be not code-heavy (the code specifics will be available on my github page). It will contan though a walk-through of what I have done in Jupyter Notebook format.

Your Webhost,  
Paulo Branco
